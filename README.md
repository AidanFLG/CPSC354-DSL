## Introduction
**Group Project: General Chemistry DSL**
Group Members: Iliana Chae, Andrew Kwon, Jaden Suh

An important aspect of both chemistry research and chemistry education is being able to understand and share the reactions between molecules of elements. When looking at a chemical equation by itself, you can check its balance, calculate the reaction stoichiometry and separate the equation into partial reactions. While there are many more interesting things that can be performed on chemical equations, such as visualizations, our group is interested in creating a chemistry DSL that would start by focusing on inputs and manipulations for chemical equations.

We'd want a user to be able to put chemical equations together and have the options to perform balancing and stoichiometry on them. We imagine this could be pretty user friendly through blocky. We'd need to be able to interpret chemical formulas of elements and have the language maintain the rules of chemistry behind the scenes. This part in particular could be tricky as a lot of the rules that we learn in general chemistry have exceptions that need to be accounted for.
