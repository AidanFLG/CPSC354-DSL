## How to Run and Test

A compiler from a blockly general chemistry DSL to JavaScript.

The program uses JavaScript variables and functions to implement the equation of chemistry elements and compound based on blockly.

### Use Element Builder blocks to make different elements

* You can type chemical symbol (H, He, Li, Be) in element block.
* You can type number in coefficient block.
* You can create compount by inserting two element blocks in compund block. 

### Use Equation Builder to write the equation among the elements

* Product equation: You can product two element together.
* Chemical reaction: You can represent the type of reaction being represented.
* Single arrow is one-way reaction and double arrow is equlilbrium reactions.
