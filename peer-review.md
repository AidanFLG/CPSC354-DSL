Hello DSL group!   

To start off, its a little confusing which file is your main file?
It also seems as though you have the same project spread out multiplue times throughout your project.

I reccomend having a work in progress file and a working file so that you have a place to show what you are currently working on and a file to show what you have done that works.
This will help keep things organized and if something goes wrong you can always look back to the working file.

I see how it can create different elements, add them together and create equations with them. 
I also see what your guys plans are from your design files and think that if you guys create everything you say you can it will look and act amazing.
I like the visualization you have created to showcase what your plans are with creating this application.
